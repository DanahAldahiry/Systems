A feedback analog system that contains a servo motor and a potentiometer that resembles a 2nd motor.



H-Bridge:


To design an H-Bridge (High current control system) circuit a transistor is needed, MOSFET - IRF540 was chosen because of it's capability to stand high currents due to it's low threshold current. It also can stand 100 volt from the source.
